Differences between Document and Window Objects

The document is part of BOM (browser object model) and dom (Document object model)
The window is part of BOM, not DOM. Properties of document objects such as title, body, cookies,
etc can also be accessed by a window like this window. document.title. Properties of the window object cannot be accessed by the document object.

document.property_name;
document.method_name;
window.property_name;
window.method_name;

// this code is not inside a function
var global1=22;
function test(){
  var local=88;
  window.global2=99;
  console.log(local);//logs 88 because
    // local is available within the body
    // of this function
  console.log(global1);//logs 22
}
console.log(typeof local);//logs undefined becaue were
  // outside the funciton body
test();
console.log(global2);//logs 99 because we added
   // global2 as a property of window
window===window.window.window;//is true
var x = 10;

On the difference between $(document) and $(window)
First of all, So $(document), this is getting the document object $(window) is the object that gets the window,
which is the browser client area Itâ€™s pretty straightforward to give you an example $(document).height()$(window).
height() Notice that the page has a scroll bar And then print out the size of th

$(document).height()
$(window).height()
Difference between document.addEventListener and window.addEventListener?
The document and window are different objects and they have some different events.
Using addEventListener() on them listens to events destined for a different object.
You should use the one that actually has the event you are interested in. For example,
there is a "resize" event on the window"resize" event on the window

function onBodyLoad(){
  document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);
  document.addEventListener("touchmove", preventBehavior, false);

  window.addEventListener('shake', shakeEventDidOccur, false);
}
<p>Some paragraph.</p>
<script>
  window.addEventListener("click", () => {
    console.log("Test");
  });
</script>
